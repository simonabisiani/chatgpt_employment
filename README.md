# Analysing tweets about ChatGPT and employment
This is a repo for a project at University of Surrey on the discourse around ChatGPT and work (employability, redundancies, threats, opportunities) that has evolved on Twitter since end on November 2022.

I found out that quering the API for the singular form of a word (e.g., job) does not necessarily return tweets with the plural form (e.g., jobs). Thus today I ran a second data collection for those words we might wanted to have in plural (teams, tasks, threats, jobs, skills, ...). 

In the repository, the file "full_dataset_chatgpt.json" is the first data collection, while "second_dataset_chatpgpt.json" is the second data collection
